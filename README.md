# 🚀 Ramazan Samat Portfolio Website

Hi, I'm Ramazan Samat, and this is the source code for my personal portfolio. This project is a showcase of my skills in modern web development, built from scratch with a focus on clean design, fluid animations, and a great user experience. It's powered by **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**.
